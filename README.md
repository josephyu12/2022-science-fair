# 2022-science-fair

In this repository, you can find all of the Jupyter Notebooks for the different models used during my science fair project (notebooks folder) as well as the raw website build (website folder).

The website is based off of a Flask (Python) backend and a static HTML frontend. There were certain attempts to use ReactJS (see react/voice subfolder) that will be expanded on in the future.
